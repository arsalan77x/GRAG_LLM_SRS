The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organizations information security management system is influenced by the organizations needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time.\nThe information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability \nof information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed.\nIt is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the \norganizations processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered \nin the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security \nmanagement system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization.\nThis International Standard can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organizations \nability to meet the organizations own information security requirements.\nThe order in which requirements are presented in this International Standard does not reflect their \nimportance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only.\nISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management \nsystems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including \nISO/IEC 27003\n[2], ISO/IEC 27004 [3] and ISO/IEC 27005 [4]), with related terms and definitions.\n \n0.2 Compatibility with other management system standards\nThis International Standard applies the high-level structure, identical sub-clause titles, identical text, \ncommon terms, and core definitions defined in Annex SL of ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1, Consolidated ISO \nSupplement, and therefore maintains compatibility with other management system standards that have adopted the Annex SL.\nThis common approach defined in the Annex  SL will be useful for those organizations that choose to operate \na single management system that meets the requirements of two or more management system standards. \n ISO/IEC 2013  All rights reserved v\nCopyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,``,`,,``,,`-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---Copyright International Organization for Standardization \nProvided by IHS under license with ISO \nLicensee=University of Alberta/5966844001, User=john, albert\nNot for Resale, 11/16/2013 21:40:53 MST\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,,```,`,```,,,`,`,`\n######################\nOutput:"}}
