Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:\n    {{\n        "title": <report_title>,\n        "summary": <executive_summary>,\n        "rating": <impact_severity_rating>,\n        "rating_explanation": <rating_explanation>,\n        "findings": [\n            {{\n                "summary":<insight_1_summary>,\n                "explanation": <insight_1_explanation>\n            }},\n            {{\n                "summary":<insight_2_summary>,\n                "explanation": <insight_2_explanation>\n            }}\n        ]\n    }}\n\n# Grounding Rules\n\nPoints supported by data should list their data references as follows:\n\n"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record ids); <dataset name> (record ids)]."\n\nDo not list more than 5 record ids in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record ids and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.\n\nFor example:\n"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (7, 2, 34, 64, 46, +more)]."\n\nwhere 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.\n\nDo not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.\n\nOutput:'}
