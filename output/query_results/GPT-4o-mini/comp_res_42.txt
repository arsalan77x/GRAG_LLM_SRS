DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Error Handling
   Reason: The requirement states that if the deletion of a selected transaction does not occur, the system automatically retries without notifying the user. This violates best practices for error handling, which emphasize the importance of user feedback and transparency in the event of an error.
   Suggested Solution: Implement a user notification system that informs the user of the failure and prompts them to retry manually or provides an option to retry.

2. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Order List Management
   Reason: The requirement mentions that the entire order list is displayed to the user, including orders in the queue. This contradicts the best practice of excluding orders in the queue from the displayed list to ensure users can only interact with relevant orders.
   Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to ensure that only completed and canceled orders are displayed, excluding any orders that are currently in the queue.

3. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: User Interaction
   Reason: While the requirement allows users to delete completed and canceled orders, it lacks clarity on how users can select multiple rows for deletion. The mention of selecting all completed and canceled orders is present, but the process for individual selections is not clearly defined.
   Suggested Solution: Provide additional details on the user interface for selecting multiple rows, ensuring clarity on how users can manage their order deletions effectively.

4. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: Key Entities Involved
   Reason: The requirement correctly identifies that users can delete orders with the status "completed" or "canceled," aligning with the intended functionality of the order management system.
   Suggested Solution: No changes needed as this aspect is compliant with best practices.

5. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: Transaction Management
   Reason: The requirement involves the deletion of orders, which is consistent with the transaction management aspect of the system, ensuring that user financial activities are managed appropriately.
   Suggested Solution: No changes needed as this aspect is compliant with best practices.

6. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: Error Handling
   Reason: The requirement does not specify how the system will handle cases where users attempt to delete inactive rows, which is a critical aspect of error handling.
   Suggested Solution: Include specific error messages for users when they attempt to delete inactive rows to enhance user experience and maintain operational integrity.
