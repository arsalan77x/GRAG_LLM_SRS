DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Order Registration Systems
   Reason: The requirement states that orders from the phone system are processed in a separate database, which contradicts the established practice of integrating phone orders into the internet system for processing by brokers. This separation undermines the interconnectedness of the order systems.
   Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to ensure that phone orders are integrated into the same database as internet orders for unified processing.

2. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Order Sorting Mechanism
   Reason: The requirement indicates that orders are sorted and processed separately based on their type (phone or internet). This contradicts the best practice of sorting all orders based on their registration date, regardless of their source, to maintain an organized order processing system.
   Suggested Solution: Revise the sorting mechanism to ensure that all orders, including phone orders, are sorted based on their registration date in a unified manner.

3. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: Error Handling Mechanisms
   Reason: The requirement states that in case of disruption in phone orders, the system continues processing without notifying the user. This is a partial violation as it does not align with the best practice of displaying appropriate messages to users in case of disruptions, which is essential for maintaining user trust.
   Suggested Solution: Implement a mechanism to notify users of any disruptions in phone orders to ensure transparency and communication.

4. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: Brokerage System Database
   Reason: The requirement mentions that orders registered in the phone system are processed, which aligns with the role of the brokerage system database in managing all orders, regardless of their origin.
   Suggested Solution: No changes needed as this aspect is compliant with the standards.

5. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: Compliance and Security Oversight
   Reason: The requirement does not address compliance and security oversight for the separate phone order database, which is necessary to ensure adherence to established security policies and standards.
   Suggested Solution: Include compliance and security measures for the separate phone order database to ensure integrity and adherence to standards.
