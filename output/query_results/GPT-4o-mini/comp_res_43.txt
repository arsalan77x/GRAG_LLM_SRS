DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Cancellation Process
   Reason: The requirement states that the system automatically retries the cancellation without notifying the user. This violates the best practice of ensuring user awareness and control over their actions, as users should be informed of any issues or retries related to their cancellation requests.
   Suggested Solution: Implement a notification mechanism to inform the user if the cancellation fails and a retry is initiated.

2. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Order Status
   Reason: The requirement indicates that all orders, regardless of status, are displayed to the user. This contradicts the established practice of only displaying orders with the "in queue" status for cancellation, which could lead to confusion and improper order management.
   Suggested Solution: Modify the system to only display orders with the "in queue" status for cancellation to ensure clarity and compliance with operational standards.

3. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: User Interaction
   Reason: While the user can select orders to cancel, the lack of clarity regarding which orders are eligible for cancellation (only those in "in queue" status) may lead to user confusion. The requirement does not explicitly state that only "in queue" orders can be canceled.
   Suggested Solution: Clearly specify in the requirement that only orders with the "in queue" status will be displayed for cancellation to enhance user understanding.

4. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: Error Handling
   Reason: The error handling mechanism does not provide adequate feedback to the user if the cancellation fails. While it mentions automatic retries, it lacks a user notification system, which is essential for maintaining user trust and system reliability.
   Suggested Solution: Introduce a user notification system that informs users of any errors or retries during the cancellation process.

5. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: Processing
   Reason: The requirement correctly outlines the process of selecting an order to cancel and marking it as "canceled," which aligns with the expected functionality of order management systems.
   Suggested Solution: No changes needed, as this aspect is compliant with best practices.
