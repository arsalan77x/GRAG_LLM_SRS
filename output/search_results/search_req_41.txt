### Entities Involved in Transferring Funds for Selling Stocks or Bonds

The process of transferring funds for selling stocks or bonds involves several key entities that play distinct roles in ensuring the transaction is completed smoothly and accurately.

#### 1. Customer's Account
The customer's account is a primary entity where the proceeds from the sale of stocks or bonds are deposited. This account is credited with the amount corresponding to the sold stocks, reflecting an increase in the customer's account balance [Data: Reports (3, 5, 12, 14, 11)].

#### 2. Buyer's Account
The buyer's account is debited by the same amount that is credited to the customer's account. This reflects the withdrawal of funds from the buyer's account to pay for the purchased stocks or bonds, resulting in a decrease in the buyer's account balance [Data: Reports (3, 5, 12, 14, 11)].

#### 3. Brokerage Account
The brokerage account is another critical entity in this process. The brokerage fee, which is a part of the transaction, is deducted from the customer's account and credited to the brokerage account. This ensures that the brokerage firm receives its fee for facilitating the transaction [Data: Reports (3, 5, 12, 14, 11)].

#### 4. Broker/Dealer
The Broker/Dealer is a central entity responsible for managing trading systems and accessing customer information. This role is crucial for facilitating transactions such as transferring funds for selling stocks or bonds, ensuring that all necessary information is available and accurate [Data: Reports (15)].

#### 5. Exchange
The Exchange collaborates with brokers and dealers to ensure market transparency and compliance. This collaboration is essential for processes like transferring funds for selling stocks or bonds, as it helps maintain the integrity and smooth operation of the market [Data: Reports (0)].

### Process Overview

During the sale process, the user selects one of their accounts, and the system automatically sets the amount for the sold stocks and the brokerage fee. The brokerage account number must be entered manually for each transaction, and the seller specifies the bank account of the buyer for fund transfer. This ensures that the correct accounts are credited and debited accordingly [Data: Reports (3, 5, 12, 14, 11)].

### Conclusion

The entities involved in the process of transferring funds for selling stocks or bonds are interconnected and play specific roles to ensure the transaction is executed correctly. The customer's account, buyer's account, brokerage account, Broker/Dealer, and Exchange all contribute to the successful completion of the transaction, reflecting the changes in account balances as described [Data: Reports (3, 5, 12, 14, 11, 15, 0)].
