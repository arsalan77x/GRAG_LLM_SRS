# Entities Related to Creating a List of Customer Shares (Creating a Portfolio)

Creating a portfolio involves several interconnected entities and processes that ensure accurate management of customer shares. Below, we outline the key entities involved in this process, based on the provided description and analysis of the dataset.

## Key Entities

### 1. **Order List**
The order list is fundamental to the portfolio creation process. It contains all transactions, and only those with a status of "completed" are considered for inclusion in the portfolio. The synchronization between the order list and the portfolio list is crucial for maintaining accurate records of customer shares [Data: Reports (39, 40, 64, 44, 35, +more)].

### 2. **Portfolio List**
The portfolio list is where the shares are recorded after a transaction is completed. It includes essential fields such as order number, transaction type, stock type, number of shares, and investment price. The portfolio is updated based on the status of orders in the order list, reflecting any changes in customer shares [Data: Reports (29, 65, +more)].

### 3. **Transaction Types**
Different transaction types play a significant role in how the portfolio is managed. These include:
- **Purchase of New Stock**: A new entry is added to the portfolio.
- **Purchase of Additional Shares**: The existing entry in the portfolio is updated to reflect the new total number of shares.
- **Sale of All Shares**: The corresponding entry is removed from the portfolio.
- **Sale of Some Shares**: The number of shares in the existing entry is updated accordingly [Data: Reports (75, 53, 18)].

### 4. **Error Handling Mechanisms**
Error handling is critical to ensure the integrity of the portfolio. If the portfolio does not update correctly following a status change in the order list, an error message is displayed, and the system attempts to rectify the issue. This mechanism is vital for maintaining accurate records and ensuring that discrepancies are addressed promptly [Data: Reports (61, 60, 37, 72, 70, +more)].

### 5. **Data Fields**
The required fields for the portfolio list are derived from the order list transactions. These fields include:
- Order Number
- Transaction Type
- Stock Type
- Number of Shares
- Investment Price
This highlights the importance of data accuracy in the portfolio management process [Data: Reports (73, 74, +more)].
