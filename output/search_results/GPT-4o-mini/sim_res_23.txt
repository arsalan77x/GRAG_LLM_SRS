# Generating a Transfer Certificate After Each Transaction

The process of generating a transfer certificate after each transaction is a critical component of transaction management in stock trading. This process ensures that all completed transactions are documented accurately and in compliance with regulatory requirements. Below, we outline the key entities involved in this process, including input data, processing steps, output, and error handling mechanisms.

## Input Data

The generation of a transfer certificate requires specific input data, which includes:

- **Name**
- **Surname**
- **National ID**
- **Shareholder ID**
- **Order Number**
- **Transaction Type**
- **Stock Type**
- **Number of Shares**
- **Share Amount**
- **Deducted Fee Amount**

This data is essential for accurately documenting each transaction and ensuring that the generated certificates reflect the correct details [Data: Reports (75, 78, 71, 53, 18)].

## Processing Steps

The processing of generating a transfer certificate involves several key steps:

1. **Transaction Status**: A certificate is generated only for transactions that have a status of "completed." This ensures that only finalized transactions are documented, maintaining the integrity of transaction records [Data: Reports (75, 78, 71, 53, 18)].

2. **Certificate Details**: Each transfer certificate includes vital information such as the transaction requester (shareholder) and order details. This transparency is crucial for accountability in the transaction process [Data: Reports (75, 78, 71, 53, 18)].

3. **Format and Accessibility**: The generated certificate must be in a specific and printable format, such as PDF or Word. This requirement highlights the need for proper formatting to provide shareholders with formal documentation of their transactions [Data: Reports (75, 78, 71, 53, 18)].

4. **Creation Date**: An automatic recording of the creation date for each transfer certificate is essential for tracking and auditing purposes, ensuring that the timeline of transactions is maintained accurately [Data: Reports (75, 78, 71, 53, 18)].

5. **Summary Table**: A summary of each transfer certificate is recorded in a separate table, with columns equivalent to the input fields. This structured approach facilitates efficient data retrieval and review, allowing users to access their transaction records easily [Data: Reports (75, 78, 71, 53, 18)].

## Output

The output of this process is the generation of a transfer certificate for each completed order. This certificate serves as a formal record of the transaction, which is crucial for both compliance and record-keeping purposes [Data: Reports (60)].
