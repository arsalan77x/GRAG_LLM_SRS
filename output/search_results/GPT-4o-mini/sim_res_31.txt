## Processing Steps

1. **Database Verification**: The entered username or email is matched against the database records. This verification is critical for ensuring that the user is legitimate and authorized to reset the password [Data: Reports (75, 78, 33)].

2. **Password Reset Page**: If the entered information is correct, the user is directed to a password reset page where they can enter their new password and captcha [Data: Reports (73)].

3. **Password Change Confirmation**: Upon successful entry of the new password and captcha, the system will change the password and provide confirmation to the user that the password has been successfully changed [Data: Reports (73)].

## Error Handling

1. **Error Messages**: The system is designed to display appropriate error messages if there are issues with the input information. This functionality is crucial for user experience and trust in the system, as it provides feedback on what went wrong during the recovery process [Data: Reports (73, 33, 72)].
