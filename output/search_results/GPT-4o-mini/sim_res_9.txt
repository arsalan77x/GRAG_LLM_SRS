# Brokerage Community and Regulatory Compliance

The community is centered around brokers, customers, and regulatory entities that govern trading activities. Brokers facilitate transactions for customers while adhering to various regulatory requirements and operational standards, ensuring a secure trading environment.

## Brokers as intermediaries in financial markets

Brokers serve as essential intermediaries in the financial markets, facilitating the buying and selling of financial instruments on behalf of clients. They are responsible for managing client accounts, executing trades, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
