1. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: Article 18
Reason: The requirement specifies that if the number of shares exceeds the available shares, an appropriate error message is displayed. This aligns with the instruction that orders not complying with restrictions should not be sent to the trading system and that customers must be informed of rejections.
Suggested Solution: No action needed as this aspect is compliant.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: Article 16
Reason: The requirement does not explicitly mention the capability to apply restrictions on the number of shares being edited in real-time, as specified in Article 16. While it checks against available shares, it does not detail how other restrictions (like minimum or maximum order registration) are handled during the editing process.
Suggested Solution: Enhance the requirement to include checks for any additional restrictions on the number of shares that may be applicable, as outlined in Article 16.SUMMARY:
