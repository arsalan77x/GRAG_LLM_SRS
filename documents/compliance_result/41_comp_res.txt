1. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: 3.7 Reconciliations and Back Office Accounting System
   - Reason: The requirement for blocking funds in a bank account does not specify how it will ensure the segregation of customer money and own funds, nor does it mention the maintenance of proper books and accounts or recording of liabilities. This is crucial for compliance with the standards outlined in the document, which emphasizes the need for clear accounting practices and reconciliation processes.
   - Suggested Solution: The requirement should be revised to include provisions for maintaining records of blocked funds, ensuring that they are accurately reflected in the accounting system, and establishing a reconciliation process to track these transactions. Additionally, it should clarify how the system will ensure that customer funds are segregated from the broker's own funds.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.
