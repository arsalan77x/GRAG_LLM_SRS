1. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: Article 20
Reason: The requirement to record and maintain all activities, events, and incidents related to customer orders aligns with the need to generate a transfer certificate for each transaction. This ensures that transaction details are documented and can be provided upon request.
Suggested Solution: Ensure that the transfer certificate generation process includes a mechanism for maintaining records in compliance with the organization's requirements.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: Article 18
Reason: The requirement states that orders received from customers should not be sent to the trading system if they do not comply with the restrictions mentioned. While the generation of a transfer certificate is a good practice, it does not explicitly address the compliance with restrictions or validations before generating the certificate. If an order is rejected due to non-compliance, it should not generate a certificate.
Suggested Solution: Implement a validation step before generating the transfer certificate to ensure that the order complies with all relevant restrictions and regulations. If an order is rejected, no certificate should be generated, and the customer should be informed accordingly.SUMMARY:

1. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: A.14.2.8 System security testing Control
Reason: The requirement includes generating a transfer certificate after each transaction, which implies that security functionality should be tested during the development of this feature to ensure that sensitive data (like national ID and shareholder ID) is handled securely.
Suggested Solution: Ensure that security testing is conducted during the development phase to validate the protection of sensitive information.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: A.18.1.4 Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information Control
Reason: The requirement involves handling personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, surname, and national ID. While the requirement does not explicitly mention how this data will be protected, it is essential to ensure compliance with privacy regulations regarding the handling and storage of PII.
Suggested Solution: Implement data protection measures such as encryption and access controls to safeguard personally identifiable information during the generation and storage of transfer certificates. Additionally, include a privacy policy that outlines how this data will be used and protected.SUMMARY:

   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: 3.5 Reports to comply with regulatory requirements
   Reason: The requirement to generate a transfer certificate after each transaction is aligned with the need for proper documentation and reporting. However, it does not explicitly mention compliance with the regulatory requirements for record-keeping and reporting as outlined in the standards. The absence of a clear reference to how the generated certificates will be utilized for regulatory compliance is a gap.
   Suggested Solution: Include a statement in the requirement that specifies how the generated transfer certificates will be used to comply with regulatory reporting requirements, ensuring that they are stored and retrievable for audits and regulatory reviews.

2. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: 3.4 Audit Logs and Privilege Roles
   Reason: The requirement includes the generation of a summary of each transfer certificate in a separate table, which aligns with the need for maintaining records and audit trails as specified in the standards.
   Suggested Solution: Ensure that the system maintains an audit log for the generation of transfer certificates, capturing details such as who generated the certificate and when, to enhance compliance with audit requirements.SUMMARY:

   - Relationship: Partial Violation
   - Content Reference: 4.8A TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENT 1 PURCHASE STOCK
   - Reason: The requirement mentions generating a transfer certificate after each transaction, but the existing content does not specify the generation of such certificates. It only discusses order confirmation numbers and transaction history updates. Therefore, while the transaction management process is compliant, it lacks the specific aspect of generating transfer certificates.
   - Suggested Solution: To resolve this partial violation, the requirement should be integrated into the existing transaction management processes, specifying that a transfer certificate will be generated and detailing its format and content. This would ensure that the generation of transfer certificates is included in the transaction management workflow.

2. 
   - Relationship: Compliance
   - Content Reference: 4.8B TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENT 2 SELL STOCK
   - Reason: Similar to the purchase stock requirement, the sell stock process also involves generating a confirmation number and updating transaction history. While it does not mention transfer certificates, it aligns with the overall transaction management principles.
   - Suggested Solution: As with the purchase stock requirement, the integration of transfer certificate generation into this process should be considered to ensure consistency across transaction types. 

Overall, the requirement for generating a transfer certificate aligns with the transaction management process but needs to be explicitly integrated into the existing requirements for clarity and completeness.
