DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Article 18
   Reason: Article 18 states that orders received from customers should not be sent to the trading system if they do not comply with the restrictions mentioned in the instruction. The requirement to delete completed and canceled orders without notifying the user contradicts the need for transparency and communication regarding order status and actions taken.
   Suggested Solution: Implement a notification system to inform the user of any failed deletion attempts, ensuring compliance with Article 18.

2. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: Article 20
   Reason: Article 20 requires the broker or broker/dealer to record and maintain all activities related to customer orders. The requirement does not specify how deletion actions are logged or if they are logged at all, which could lead to a lack of accountability and traceability for deleted orders.
   Suggested Solution: Ensure that all deletion actions are logged with timestamps and reasons for deletion to maintain compliance with Article 20.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
1. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: Article 29
   - Reason: Article 29 states that the broker or broker/dealer must ensure immediate problem resolution for customers upon request. The requirement's error handling mechanism, which automatically retries the deletion without notifying the user, does not align with the expectation of providing immediate support and transparency to the customer regarding issues encountered during the deletion process.
   - Suggested Solution: Modify the error handling process to notify the user if a deletion fails and provide options for resolution or confirmation of the retry attempt. This would ensure compliance with the requirement for immediate problem resolution and customer communication.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
1. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: 6.1.1 General
   - Reason: The requirement does not address the risks associated with deleting orders, such as the potential loss of data integrity or availability. It lacks a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of the deletion process and does not consider the implications of not conforming to information security management system requirements.
   - Suggested Solution: Implement a confirmation step before deletion, along with logging the deletion actions for audit purposes. Additionally, ensure that there is a rollback mechanism in case of accidental deletions to maintain data integrity.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
1. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: 10.1 Nonconformity and corrective action
   - Reason: The error handling process described states that if the deletion of a selected transaction does not occur, the system automatically retries without notifying the user. This violates the requirement to react to nonconformities and take action to control and correct them, as well as the need to deal with the consequences of such failures. Users should be informed of any issues that occur during the deletion process to ensure transparency and allow for corrective actions.
   - Suggested Solution: Modify the error handling process to notify the user if the deletion fails and provide options for the user to take corrective action or confirm the retry. This aligns with the principles of user accountability and transparency in error handling.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
1. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: A.12.3.1 Information backup Control
   - Reason: The requirement does not mention any backup or recovery mechanism for the orders being deleted. According to the standard, backup copies of information should be taken and tested regularly to protect against data loss.
   - Suggested Solution: Implement a backup mechanism that ensures that completed and canceled orders are backed up before deletion, allowing for recovery in case of accidental deletion or system failure.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

Relationship: Complete Violation  
Content Reference: A.16.1.1 Responsibilities and procedures  
Reason: The requirement states that if the deletion of a selected transaction does not occur, the system automatically retries without notifying the user. This approach does not align with the best practices for incident management, which emphasize the need for a quick, effective, and orderly response to information security incidents. Users should be informed of any issues that occur during the deletion process to ensure transparency and allow them to take appropriate action.  
Suggested Solution: Modify the error handling process to notify the user if the deletion fails, providing them with options to retry or cancel the operation. This will enhance user experience and align with the incident management controls outlined in the standards.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: 3.1.1 Client Account Management
   - Reason: The requirement allows for the deletion of completed and canceled orders, which contradicts the standard that states client information (including order history) must not be deleted once operational. This could lead to a lack of accountability and traceability in the system.
   - Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to prevent deletion of completed and canceled orders. Instead, consider implementing a mechanism to mark these orders as "inactive" or "archived" while retaining them in the system for historical reference.

2. 
   - Relationship: Complete Violation
   - Content Reference: 3.4 Audit Logs and Privilege Roles
   - Reason: The error handling mechanism states that if deletion fails, the system retries without notifying the user. This violates the requirement for maintaining audit logs and transparency in user actions, as users should be informed of any issues that occur during critical operations like order deletion.
   - Suggested Solution: Implement a notification system to inform users of failed deletions and provide them with options to retry or investigate the issue further.

3. 
   - Relationship: Partial Violation
   - Content Reference: 3.3 Maker and Checker functionality
   - Reason: The requirement does not mention any form of approval or verification process (maker and checker) before deleting orders. This could lead to unauthorized deletions and lack of segregation of duties.
   - Suggested Solution: Introduce a maker and checker functionality for the deletion of orders, requiring confirmation from a second user before any deletion is finalized.

Overall, the requirement for deleting completed and canceled orders does not align with the established standards and best practices, particularly regarding data retention and auditability. Adjustments are necessary to ensure compliance and maintain the integrity of the system.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.
