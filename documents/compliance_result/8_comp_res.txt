1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation  
Content Reference: Article 18  
Reason: The requirement states that if the number of shares exceeds the available shares, an error message is displayed. However, it does not mention that orders should not be sent to the trading system if they do not comply with the restrictions, which includes exceeding available shares. This is a direct violation of the requirement that orders must not be processed if they do not comply with regulations.  
Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to ensure that if the number of shares exceeds the available shares, the order should not be updated or sent to the trading system, and the user should be informed accordingly.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation  
Content Reference: Article 16  
Reason: The requirement allows for editing the number of shares, but it does not specify the need for restrictions on the order volume or the maximum number of shares that can be edited. This could lead to potential violations of trading limits or regulations.  
Suggested Solution: Include a check to ensure that the edited number of shares adheres to any applicable restrictions on order volume as specified in Article 16.

3. 
Relationship: Compliance  
Content Reference: Article 20  
Reason: The error handling mechanism described in the requirement aligns with the need to record and maintain all activities related to customer orders, including error messages and user interactions. This ensures compliance with the requirement to maintain proper records.  
Suggested Solution: Continue to ensure that all error handling and order updates are properly logged as per the organization's requirements.SUMMARY:
