DETAILED ANALYSIS:
Relationship: Complete Violation  
Content Reference: 4.4 ACCOUNT SET UP REQUIREMENTS  
Reason: The requirement for registering a new member includes a significantly broader set of personal details than what is specified in the existing account setup requirements. The existing requirements do not mention the need for a father's name, ID number, ID serial number, birth place, national code, education, gender, marital status, shareholder code, or access type. Additionally, the requirement states that all necessary information must be entered by the broker, which is not aligned with the user-driven account setup process outlined in the existing document.  
Suggested Solution: To resolve this violation, the requirement should be revised to align with the existing account setup requirements. It should specify which fields are mandatory and ensure that the registration process is user-driven rather than broker-driven. Additionally, the requirement should be streamlined to focus on essential information that is consistent with the current standards.
