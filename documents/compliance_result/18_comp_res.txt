DETAILED ANALYSIS:
Relationship: Complete Violation  
Content Reference: Article 5  
Reason: The requirement states that orders registered in the phone system are to be processed in the internet system. However, Article 5 specifies that if a customer opts to send orders through an intermediary trader (which could include phone orders), the broker or broker/dealer must immediately forward the orders to the trading system according to the chronological order of receipt and other regulations. The requirement does not mention the immediate forwarding of phone orders to the trading system, which is a violation of the specified regulations.  
Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to ensure that all phone orders are forwarded to the trading system immediately upon receipt, in compliance with Article 5. Additionally, clarify the process for handling phone orders to align with the regulations outlined in the standards.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: Article 25
   Reason: The requirement does not mention any contingency plan or alternative methods for order registration and transmission in case of disruption in the phone order system. Article 25 mandates immediate notification to customers and provision of alternative methods during disruptions, which is not addressed in the requirement.
   Suggested Solution: Include a clause in the requirement that specifies how customers will be notified of disruptions and what alternative methods will be provided for order registration and transmission.

2. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: Article 29
   Reason: While the requirement mentions error handling by displaying an appropriate message to the user in case of disruption, it lacks details on the necessary support services for the infrastructures involved in processing phone orders. Article 29 emphasizes the need for immediate problem resolution for customers upon request, which is not fully covered in the requirement.
   Suggested Solution: Expand the error handling section to include specific support services and procedures for resolving issues related to phone order disruptions, ensuring that customers can receive timely assistance.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: 3.3 Maker and Checker functionality
Reason: The requirement does not explicitly mention the implementation of a maker and checker functionality for the registration of phone orders in the internet system. This functionality is crucial for ensuring proper segregation of duties and auditing for each transaction, which is a standard outlined in the Broker Back Office Application Standards.
Suggested Solution: Incorporate a maker and checker process for the registration of phone orders to ensure that one individual creates the order while another confirms or authorizes it before it is processed in the brokerage system.

2. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: 3.4 Audit Logs and Privilege Roles
Reason: The requirement mentions that orders from the phone system are processed in the brokerage system database, which implies that there should be an audit trail for these transactions. This aligns with the need for audit logs to track user activity and modifications.
Suggested Solution: Ensure that the system maintains comprehensive audit logs for all phone orders registered in the internet system, including timestamps and user identification.

Overall, while there are compliant aspects of the requirement, the lack of a maker and checker functionality represents a partial violation of the established standards.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.
