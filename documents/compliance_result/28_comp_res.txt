   - Content Reference: 3.2 Trading
   - Reason: The requirement for displaying real-time market data aligns with the need for trading functionality; however, it lacks specific mention of compliance with Information and Application Security Standards as specified in the standards document. The standards emphasize the importance of security in handling market data, which is not addressed in the requirement.
   - Suggested Solution: Include a statement in the requirement that ensures compliance with Information and Application Security Standards, such as securing data feeds and implementing access controls for users accessing real-time market data.

2. 
   - Relationship: Compliance
   - Content Reference: 3.5 Reports to comply with regulatory requirements
   - Reason: The requirement to display live stock prices and market news is compliant with the need for timely information dissemination to users, which is essential for trading and decision-making.
   - Suggested Solution: None needed, as this aspect is compliant. 

Overall, while the requirement for real-time market data is largely compliant with the standards, it should be enhanced to address security considerations to ensure full compliance.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.
