DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: 4.8A TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENT 1 PURCHASE STOCK
Reason: The requirement specifies that the user must log in and that the system checks the stock availability, which is compliant. However, it does not mention the need for the user to have sufficient funds in their account before proceeding with the purchase, which is a critical aspect of transaction management. This omission could lead to situations where a user attempts to purchase stocks without adequate funds, violating best practices for financial transactions.
Suggested Solution: Include a check for sufficient funds in the user's account before allowing the purchase to proceed.

Suggested Solution: Clearly define the process for "regular" access users, including any restrictions or alternative options available to them when attempting to purchase stocks.
