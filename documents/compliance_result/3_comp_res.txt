DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: Article 16: Capability to apply restrictions
Reason: The requirement does not specify any restrictions on the type of order, time of activity, or trading activities on a particular trading symbol, which is necessary to ensure compliance with the organization's requirements.
Suggested Solution: Implement restrictions on order types, trading symbols, and other specified conditions as outlined in Article 16.

2. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: Article 18: Orders received from customers
Reason: The requirement lacks a mechanism to reject orders that do not comply with the restrictions mentioned in Article 1, which could lead to unauthorized transactions.
Suggested Solution: Introduce a validation process that checks orders against the defined restrictions before they are accepted into the system.

3. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: Article 6: Secure multi-factor authentication
Reason: While the requirement mentions that the user must log into their account, it does not specify the use of secure multi-factor authentication, which is a security requirement.
Suggested Solution: Ensure that the login process includes secure multi-factor authentication as per Article 6.

4. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: Article 20: Record and maintain all activities
Reason: The requirement states that each online purchase order is recorded in the user's order list, but it does not mention maintaining detailed logs of all activities related to the order, such as changes in order status or user interactions.
Suggested Solution: Implement a comprehensive logging mechanism to track all activities related to online purchases, including status changes and user interactions.

5. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: Article 5: Forwarding orders to the trading system
Reason: The requirement includes a process for checking account balances and blocking amounts until final confirmation, which aligns with the need for proper order processing and management.
