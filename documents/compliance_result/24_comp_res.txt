DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: Article 6
Reason: The requirement specifies the use of captcha for logging in, which aligns with the need for secure multi-factor authentication as mandated by the organization.
Suggested Solution: Continue implementing captcha as part of the login process to ensure compliance with security requirements.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: Article 7
Reason: While the requirement mentions error handling for incorrect login attempts, it does not explicitly state the need for secure handling of user credentials or the logging of failed attempts, which is implied by the security requirements specified in Article 7.
Suggested Solution: Enhance the requirement to include secure handling of user credentials and logging of failed login attempts to fully comply with security requirements.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: A.9.4 System and application access control
Reason: The requirement does not specify the implementation of secure log-on procedures, which is essential for preventing unauthorized access to systems and applications as per the standard.
Suggested Solution: Implement a secure log-on procedure that includes measures such as two-factor authentication or secure password storage mechanisms.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: A.9.2.4 Management of secret authentication information of users
Reason: While the requirement mentions the use of a username and password, it lacks details on how the secret authentication information (password) is managed, such as whether it is stored securely or if there are policies for password complexity and expiration.
Suggested Solution: Define and document a password management policy that includes guidelines for password complexity, storage, and expiration to enhance security.SUMMARY:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: A.9.4.3 Password management system Control
   Reason: The requirement does not specify the use of a password management system that ensures quality passwords, which is necessary for compliance with the standard.
   Suggested Solution: Implement a password management system that enforces password complexity requirements and provides guidance on creating strong passwords.

2. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: A.12.4.1 Event logging Control
   Reason: While the requirement mentions error handling, it does not explicitly state that user login attempts (successful and failed) should be logged for security monitoring purposes, which is a partial compliance issue.
   Suggested Solution: Include a logging mechanism that records all login attempts, including timestamps and whether they were successful or failed.

3. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: A.9.4.4 Use of privileged utility programs Control
   Reason: The requirement does not mention the use of privileged utility programs, but it does not violate this control either, as it focuses on user login functionality without overriding system controls.
   Suggested Solution: Ensure that any privileged utility programs used in the login process are restricted and tightly controlled, although this is already implied by the nature of the requirement.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: A.14.2.8 System security testing Control
Reason: The requirement does not mention any security testing of the login functionality, which is critical to ensure that the login process is secure and protects against vulnerabilities such as brute force attacks.
Suggested Solution: Implement security testing procedures for the login functionality, including testing for vulnerabilities and ensuring that the system can handle multiple failed login attempts securely.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: A.18.1.4 Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information Control
Reason: While the requirement mentions capturing username and password, it does not specify how the system will protect this sensitive information during transmission and storage, which is essential for compliance with privacy regulations.
Suggested Solution: Ensure that the system uses encryption for transmitting and storing usernames and passwords to protect users' personally identifiable information. Additionally, include a statement in the requirement about how this data will be secured.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: 3.1.1.1 KYC Principles
Reason: The requirement for logging into the system includes a username and password, which aligns with the need for secure access to client information as stated in the KYC principles. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
Suggested Solution: No action needed as this aspect is compliant.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: 3.4 Audit Logs and Privilege Roles
Reason: While the requirement mentions error handling for incorrect login attempts, it does not specify the logging of these attempts or the actions taken after multiple failed attempts. The standards require that the system should generate and store audit logs for all users, including login attempts and error handling.
Suggested Solution: Enhance the requirement to include logging of failed login attempts and the corresponding actions taken (e.g., locking the account after a certain number of failed attempts) to ensure compliance with audit logging standards.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: 4.3 LOGIN REQUIREMENTS
Reason: The requirement specifies the use of a captcha during the login process, which is not mentioned in the original content. Additionally, the original content allows for up to four login attempts, while the new requirement limits it to three attempts, which is a deviation from the established standard.
Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to align with the original content by removing the captcha requirement and allowing up to four attempts before any lockout period is enforced.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: 4.3 LOGIN REQUIREMENTS
Reason: The original content does not specify a waiting period after failed login attempts, while the new requirement introduces a 20-second wait after three consecutive incorrect attempts. This is a deviation from the original process, which does not include such a mechanism.
Suggested Solution: Consider integrating a waiting period after multiple failed attempts, but ensure it aligns with the original requirement of allowing four attempts before any lockout or wait time is enforced.
