DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: A.8.3 Media handling
   Reason: The requirement does not specify secure handling and storage procedures for transaction data, which is crucial to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of sensitive information.
   Suggested Solution: Implement and document procedures for secure handling, storage, and access control of transaction data in accordance with the information classification scheme.

2. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: A.9.1 Business requirements of access control
   Reason: While the requirement mentions user account details and secure database storage, it lacks a comprehensive access control policy to ensure that only authorized users can access their transaction history.
   Suggested Solution: Establish and document an access control policy that defines user access rights to transaction data, ensuring that users can only access their own transaction history and that access is logged and monitored.SUMMARY:

   Relationship: Complete Violation
   Content Reference: A.18.1.4 Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information Control
   Reason: The requirement does not explicitly mention how it will ensure the privacy and protection of personally identifiable information (PII) when handling user account details and transaction data. This is crucial for compliance with legal and regulatory requirements regarding data protection.
   Suggested Solution: Implement measures to ensure that PII is encrypted and access is restricted to authorized personnel only. Additionally, include a privacy policy that outlines how user data will be handled and protected.

2. 
   Relationship: Partial Violation
   Content Reference: A.14.2.8 System security testing Control
   Reason: While the requirement mentions secure database storage, it does not specify any security testing of the system's functionality, particularly regarding the security of transaction data retrieval and storage.
   Suggested Solution: Establish a security testing plan that includes testing for vulnerabilities in the transaction history retrieval process and database security.

3. 
   Relationship: Compliance
   Content Reference: A.16.1.1 Responsibilities and procedures Control
   Reason: The error handling aspect of the requirement indicates a structured approach to managing errors, which aligns with the need for established procedures to respond to information security incidents.
   Suggested Solution: Ensure that the error handling procedures are well-documented and include steps for logging incidents and notifying relevant personnel if necessary.SUMMARY:

DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: 3.4 Audit Logs and Privilege Roles
Reason: The requirement does not mention the generation and storage of audit logs for all users and information in respect of transaction history, which is a critical aspect of maintaining security and accountability in the system.
Suggested Solution: Include a provision for generating and storing audit logs for all transaction history retrievals, detailing user access, data entry, and any modifications made to the transaction records.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: 3.5 Reports to comply with regulatory requirements
Reason: While the requirement mentions providing detailed records of past transactions, it does not specify the need for compliance with regulatory reporting requirements or the generation of specific reports that may be required by the Exchange.
Suggested Solution: Ensure that the system includes functionality to generate reports related to transaction history that comply with regulatory requirements, such as transaction summaries or detailed reports as specified in the standards.

Overall, the requirement for Transaction History needs to be enhanced to ensure compliance with the established standards and best practices.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.
