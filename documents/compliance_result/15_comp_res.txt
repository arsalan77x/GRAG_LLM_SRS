   - Content Reference: Article 20
   - Reason: The requirement to delete completed and canceled orders aligns with the need to maintain records of customer orders. However, it does not explicitly mention the necessity to record and maintain all activities related to customer orders, including deletions, which is a requirement stated in Article 20.
   - Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to include a provision for recording the deletion of completed and canceled orders, ensuring compliance with the record-keeping requirements outlined in Article 20.SUMMARY:

Relationship: Complete Violation  
Content Reference: 3.1.1 Client Account Management  
Reason: The requirement states that client information (including order details) stored in the system at the time of account operation shall not be allowed to be deleted once operational. This directly contradicts the proposed functionality of allowing users to delete completed and canceled orders from their order list.  
Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to ensure that completed and canceled orders are not deleted from the system. Instead, consider implementing a "hide" or "archive" functionality that allows users to manage their view of the order list without violating the standard of retaining all client information.No directly related content found in the trained document for this requirement.
