DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 
Relationship: Compliance
Content Reference: Article 18
Reason: The requirement to cancel orders in the queue aligns with the stipulation that orders received from customers should not be sent to the trading system if they do not comply with the restrictions. The process of canceling an order is a necessary function to ensure that only valid orders are processed.
Suggested Solution: None needed, as this aspect is compliant.

2. 
Relationship: Partial Violation
Content Reference: Article 5
Reason: While the requirement allows users to cancel orders in the "in queue" status, Article 5 states that if a customer opts to send orders through an intermediary trader, the broker or broker/dealer must immediately forward the orders to the trading system according to the chronological order of receipt. The requirement does not address how the cancellation interacts with orders sent through intermediaries, which could lead to potential issues if not handled properly.
Suggested Solution: Clarify how the cancellation process will handle orders that have been sent through intermediaries to ensure compliance with Article 5.SUMMARY:
