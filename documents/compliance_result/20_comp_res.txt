   - Relationship: Partial Violation
   - Content Reference: Article 9
   - Reason: The requirement to display company announcements does not explicitly mention the need to publicly announce operational infrastructures related to trading, which is a requirement in Article 9. While the requirement itself is compliant in terms of displaying announcements, it lacks clarity on how these announcements relate to the operational infrastructures that must be publicly announced.
   - Suggested Solution: Clarify how the company announcements feature aligns with the operational infrastructures that need to be publicly announced on the broker's official website, ensuring compliance with Article 9.

Overall, while the requirement for providing company announcements is largely compliant, it could benefit from additional clarity regarding its alignment with the standards set forth in the document.SUMMARY:
