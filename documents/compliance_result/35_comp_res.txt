Relationship: Complete Violation
Content Reference: 4.6 CASH MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
Reason: The requirement for transferring funds for selling stocks or bonds does not specify the necessary checks for sufficient funds in the buyer's account before the transaction is processed. The existing cash management requirements emphasize the need to verify sufficient funds before proceeding with withdrawals, which is not addressed in the provided requirement.
