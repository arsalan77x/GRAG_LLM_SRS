Performance and Availability
The system has several objectives related to performance, including speed, fault tolerance, throughput,
and processing time. The performance criteria for the brokerage system are as follows:
Response Time (for online trading): The maximum response time from when a customer starts a purchase or sale until the final result is returned should be within 500 milliseconds, assuming simultaneous usage by 4 million users in a 3-hour window (9 AM to 12 PM). This time can vary depending on the stock exchange's rate changes and availability.

Minimum Response Time (for online trading): The minimum acceptable response time from a customer's perspective should be within 100 milliseconds, assuming simultaneous usage by 4 million users in a 3-hour window (9 AM to 12 PM).

Availability: The system must be available from 9 AM to 12 PM daily for trading and requests, ensuring a 99% uptime. Transactions must be processed within 500 milliseconds.

Minimum Number of Requests: The system must handle a minimum of 4 million requests during the 3-hour availability window, assuming each user makes at least one request.

Simultaneous Users: The system must support a minimum of 4 million simultaneous users during the 3-hour window.

Scalability: The system should be designed to scale beyond 4 million users, handling up to 6 million simultaneous users and 6 million requests within the 3-hour window, with no degradation in performance. The system must also handle sudden surges in traffic (up to 50% more than the expected number of users) without failure.

Graceful Degradation: In the case of system overload or partial failure, the system must maintain core functionality (e.g., basic order submission) and provide feedback to users about degraded service (e.g., longer response times), without crashing or becoming unavailable. Non-essential features should degrade first, allowing critical trading operations to continue.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO): In the event of a system failure, the system must be restored to full operational status within 15 minutes to minimize disruption during the trading window.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO): In the event of a system failure, no more than 5 minutes of data should be lost, ensuring minimal disruption to user transactions and data integrity.

Users accessing the system via the internet or through brokers can fill out forms and submit them to brokers outside of the 9 AM to 12 PM window.

It's important to define a common criterion for system performance, accepted by all related entities. For example, a test transaction with minimal data on a web page is different from a transaction on a page with many fields and images. Therefore, both systems must be comparable based on the agreed criteria.
