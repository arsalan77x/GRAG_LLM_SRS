Session Management
Session management involves maintaining user state after the initial connection. Key considerations for
session management include:
• Session ID Security: Session IDs must be secure and randomly generated.
• Session Expiration: Sessions must expire after a defined period.
• Session Termination: Users must be able to log out and terminate their sessions.
• Secure Transmission: Session IDs and cookies must be transmitted over encrypted connections
