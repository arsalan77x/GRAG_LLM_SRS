Title: Logging Out of the System

Description: The user logs out of their account, securely terminates the session, and is redirected to the main page.

Input: None

Processing: When the user selects the "Logout" option, the system securely terminates the user's session on both the client and server sides, ensuring that no session data remains active. All session tokens, cookies, and any authentication-related data (including MFA tokens, if applicable) are invalidated. The logout action is logged for monitoring and auditing purposes. The user is redirected to the main page upon successful logout.

Output: The user is logged out of their account and redirected to the main page. Logout activity is recorded in system logs for security auditing and monitoring.

Error Handling: If an error occurs during the logout process, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the system ensures that the session is safely terminated to prevent unauthorized access. Error logs are generated for review, and any security incidents related to the logout process are escalated as per incident management procedures.
