Data Validation
Data validation involves reviewing, filtering, and removing malicious input to ensure data security. The
following are common attacks mitigated by input validation:
• SQL Injection: This attack exploits vulnerabilities in the application's data validation process,
allowing attackers to execute database commands. It occurs when user input is used in SQL
queries without proper validation, enabling attackers to perform actions like impersonation,
altering or deleting data, and denial of service.
• Buffer Overflow: A buffer is a temporary storage area in memory. If an attacker inputs data
exceeding the buffer's capacity, it may cause unpredictable behavior, including denial of service
or code injection attacks.
• Code Injection: This attack aims to exploit web applications by injecting malicious code. The
attacker uses the application to steal user information, such as login credentials and banking
information.
