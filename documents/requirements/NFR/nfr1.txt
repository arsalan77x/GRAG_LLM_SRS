Performance and Availability
The system has several objectives related to performance, including speed, fault tolerance, throughput,
and processing time. The performance criteria for the brokerage system are as follows:
• Response Time (for online trading): The maximum response time from when a customer starts
a purchase or sale until the final result is returned should be within 500 milliseconds, assuming
simultaneous usage by 4 million users in a 3-hour window (9 AM to 12 PM). This time can vary
depending on the stock exchange's rate changes and availability.
• Minimum Response Time (for online trading): The minimum acceptable response time from a
customer's perspective should be within 100 milliseconds, assuming simultaneous usage by 4
million users in a 3-hour window (9 AM to 12 PM).
• Availability: The system must be available from 9 AM to 12 PM daily for trading and requests,
ensuring a 99% uptime. Transactions must be processed within 500 milliseconds.
• Minimum Number of Requests: The system must handle a minimum of 4 million requests
during the 3-hour availability window, assuming each user makes at least one request.
• Simultaneous Users: The system must support a minimum of 4 million simultaneous users
during the 3-hour window.
Users accessing the system via the internet or through brokers can fill out forms and submit them to
brokers outside of the 9 AM to 12 PM window.
It's important to define a common criterion for system performance, accepted by all related entities. For
example, a test transaction with minimal data on a web page is different from a transaction on a page
with many fields and images. Therefore, both systems must be comparable based on the agreed criteria.
