Authorization
Authorization determines what actions a user is permitted to perform and which resources they can
access. System resources include files, databases, registry keys, configuration settings, etc. Key
considerations for authorization include:
• Access Control: Users must not be able to access resources without proper authentication.
• Post-Logout Access Control: Users must not be able to access resources after logging out.
• Access Level Management: Access to resources must be managed according to user access
levels.
