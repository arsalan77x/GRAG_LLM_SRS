Compatibility
The brokerage system must be compatible with other applications and services without causing
interference. The system should continue to operate smoothly alongside other installed applications. The
following compatibility requirements must be considered:
• No Adverse Effects: The system should not adversely affect the performance of other
applications installed in the same environment. This includes both direct effects (like stopping
other programs) and indirect effects (like consuming all resources).
• Updates and Compatibility: Updating applications should not damage the system's
compatibility.
• Shared Resources: Resources shared among programs should not cause compatibility issues in
the system.
