Security
Information security in the brokerage system refers to preventing unauthorized access, ensuring data integrity, and protecting against data breaches or destruction. The following are the security requirements for the system, which must be supported by appropriate mechanisms:

Data Validation:
All user input, including form data, transaction requests, and queries, must be properly validated to ensure no malicious data (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) can be entered into the system. Input sanitization should be applied only on the client-side to reduce processing overhead and ensure quick response times for users.

Authentication:
The system must use strong, multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to verify user identities. This includes using secure passwords, biometrics, or one-time passwords (OTPs) for users, ensuring only legitimate users can access their accounts. All authentication data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent interception or misuse.

Authorization:
The system must implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can only access the data and system features they are permitted to use based on their role (e.g., customer, broker, admin). Any attempt to access unauthorized resources should be logged and flagged for review.

Exception Management:
All exceptions or errors must be handled securely, ensuring no sensitive system information (such as stack traces or error codes) is exposed to end users. Instead, generic error messages should be shown. Additionally, exceptions must be logged for auditing purposes, ensuring proper diagnosis and remediation of security-related issues.

Session Management:
Sessions should be managed securely with unique session tokens for each authenticated user. Sessions must time out after a period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes) and be automatically terminated if suspicious activity is detected. Session tokens should be stored securely and not exposed in URLs or local storage. For sensitive operations, session re-authentication should be required.

Encryption:
All sensitive data, including user credentials, personal information, transaction details, and communication between the user and the system, must be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.2/1.3 for data in transit). This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be read or tampered with.

Audit Logs:
The system must maintain secure audit logs of all significant actions (e.g., login attempts, transactions, data modifications). Logs should be immutable and stored in a secure location to protect against tampering. Audit logs must include user ID, action performed, timestamp, and IP address, ensuring accountability and traceability.

Intrusion Detection and Prevention:
The system must have intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) in place to monitor and block potential attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), brute-force attacks, or other unauthorized access attempts. Alerts should be generated for any suspicious activity, and the system should respond to threats automatically where possible (e.g., locking user accounts after multiple failed login attempts).

Security Patching and Updates:
The system must have a process in place to ensure that all software components, including third-party libraries, are regularly updated and patched for known vulnerabilities. Security patches should be applied promptly to prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities.

**The original NFR stated that input sanitization should be applied on both the client-side and server-side, which is a best practice. input sanitization is only applied on the client-side to "reduce processing overhead." This creates a violation of ISO/IEC 27001 (Clause A.9.4), which requires the secure handling of input data. Server-side validation is critical to prevent malicious data from reaching the backend, and this change leaves the system vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) if the client-side validation is bypassed.
**ISO/IEC 27001 requires an incident management process, which includes reporting, response procedures, and logging of security incidents (Clause A.16). However, this NFR lacks any mention of incident management procedures for handling security breaches or responding to detected threats. For compliance, the NFR should include a requirement for defining and implementing a formal incident response plan, which ensures quick and effective handling of security incidents. This would cover steps for incident detection, escalation, investigation, resolution, and post-incident analysis.
