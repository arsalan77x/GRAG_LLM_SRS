Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of clients (users, processes, or systems) interacting
with the application. Key features to be considered in the authentication process include:
• Secure Mechanism for Authentication: The system must implement a reliable mechanism for
authentication.
• Protection of Sensitive Functions: All sensitive functions and resources must be protected by
authentication mechanisms.
• Storage of Credentials: User credentials must be hashed using a secure algorithm before
storage.
• Encrypted Communication: User credentials must be transmitted over encrypted connections.
