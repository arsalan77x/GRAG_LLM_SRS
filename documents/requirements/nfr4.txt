Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of clients (users, processes, or systems) interacting with the application. A robust authentication system is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring only authorized users gain access to system resources. Key features to be considered in the authentication process include:

Secure Mechanism for Authentication:
The system must implement a reliable and secure authentication mechanism, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), that requires users to verify their identity using multiple forms of validation (e.g., password, one-time passcode, biometric data). This reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if one authentication factor is compromised.

Protection of Sensitive Functions:
All sensitive functions and resources, including those that modify financial data, user profiles, or system configurations, must be protected by authentication mechanisms. These operations should require re-authentication or additional security measures (e.g., MFA) to ensure that only the legitimate user can perform these actions.

Storage of Credentials:
User credentials must be securely stored using strong hashing algorithms, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to prevent unauthorized access to passwords. Additionally, salted hashing should be used to add an extra layer of protection against precomputed attacks like rainbow table attacks.

Encrypted Communication:
User credentials must be transmitted over encrypted connections using secure protocols, such as TLS 1.2 or higher, to prevent interception during transmission (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks). All authentication-related communications between the client and server must be encrypted to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

Account Lockout Mechanism:
The system should implement an account lockout mechanism after a defined number of failed login attempts to protect against brute-force attacks. After multiple failed authentication attempts, the account should be temporarily locked or additional verification steps (such as CAPTCHA or MFA) should be required.
