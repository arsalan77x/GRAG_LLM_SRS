Volume Management
The quality requirement for volume management aims to define the maximum amount of data that can
be stored in the database. Due to the possibility of up to 4 million users accessing the brokerage system
simultaneously within a 3-hour window (9 AM to 12 PM), with each user submitting at least one request
(usually more), a large volume of data must be processed and stored in the database. The system must
have appropriate mechanisms for managing this vast amount of data and consider the following points:
• Processing Speed: The system's processing speed should not slow down due to the large
volume of data exchanged.
• Data Integrity: In case of exchanging a large volume of data, the data should not reach its
threshold and cause database corruption. Appropriate warnings should be displayed when
nearing thresholds.
• Data Loss Prevention: Exchanging a large volume of data should not lead to data loss or failure
to store new data.
• Maximum Disk Volume: The maximum number of requests during the 3-hour window must be
considered for setting the maximum file size and buffer size in the file system.
