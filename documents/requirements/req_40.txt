Title  Transferring Funds for Selling Stocks or Bonds  
Description  The amount corresponding to the sold stocks is deposited into the customer's account, and 
the amount is withdrawn from the buyer's account. The brokerage fee is also withdrawn 
from the buyer's account and deposited into the brokerage account.  
Input  Customer account number, stock or bond amount, brokerage fee, buyer's account number, 
brokerage account number  
Processing  During the sale process, the user selects one of their accounts. The account balance is 
checked, and the system sets the amount for the sold stocks and the brokerage fee. The 
brokerage account is recorded in the system's database and needs only to be retrieved. The 
stock exchange interface specifies the bank account of the buyer, and the funds are 
transferred accordingly.  
Output  Increase in customer account balance by the stock amount, decrease in customer account 
balance by the brokerage fee amount, decrease in buyer's account balance by the stock 
amount.  
Error Handling  If there is an error in setting the account numbers, amounts, or if the stock exchange 
interface does not specify the buyer's account number, an appropriate error message is 
displayed.
