Processing  During the purchase process, the user selects one of their accounts, and the balance is 
checked. If sufficient, the amount for the stocks and the brokerage fee is blocked. The 
system sets the amount for the purchased stocks and the brokerage fee. The broke rage 
account is recorded in the system's database and needs only to be retrieved. The stock 
exchange interface specifies the bank account of the stock owner, and the funds are 
transferred accordingly.

account balance by the stock amount, and increase in brokerage account balance by the 
brokerage fee amount.

interface does not specify the stock owner's account number, an appropriate error message 
is displayed.
