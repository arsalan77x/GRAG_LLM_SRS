Creating a List of Customer Shares (Creating a Portfolio)  
Title  Creating a list of customer shares (creating a portfolio)  
Description  Whenever a purchase or sale is completed, the purchased or sold shares are added to a list 
called the portfolio.  
Input  Order number, transaction type, stock type, number of shares, investment price  
Processing  From the existing transactions in the order list, those with the status field set to 
"completed" are added to another list called the portfolio. The required fields for the 
portfolio list are fewer and only include some fields from the order list transactions: order 
number, transaction type, stock type, number of shares, investment price. The order list 
and the po rtfolio list should be synchronized. Whenever an order status in the order list 
changes from "in queue" to "completed," the following scenarios are checked:  
• If the completed order is for the purchase of a new stock type, a new report is added to the 
portfolio.  
• If the completed order is for the purchase of more shares of an existing stock type, the number of 
shares field is updated.  
• If the completed order is for the sale of all shares of a stock type, the report is removed from the 
portfolio.  
• If the completed order is for the sale of some shares, the number of shares field is updated. | | 
Output | Increasing or decreasing shares in the portfolio | | Error Handling | If the status change 
of an order in the order list to "completed" does not upda te the portfolio, it indicates an error. 
This can occur if the addition of a new report, removal of an existing report, or updating the 
number of shares field does not happen. An appropriate error message is displayed, and the 
system attempts to update aga in. |
