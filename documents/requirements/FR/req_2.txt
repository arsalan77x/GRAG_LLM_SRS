Title: User Account Management

Description: The user can edit their account information securely, with validation and logging of critical changes.

Input: The user can enter information related to personal details, contact details, bank details (associated with the account at the brokerage), and username for changes.

Processing: All fields related to the customer account are displayed as editable. The user can modify any information and enter new details. If the user changes their bank account, the validity of the new bank account must be checked. The request for bank account validation is securely sent to the bank. If there is no error in entering the new information and the bank confirms the new account, the new information is securely recorded in the database, and the changes are logged for auditing purposes.

Output: The new information related to the user account is recorded in the database.

Error Handling: If there is an error in entering any of the information, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the user is allowed to re-enter the information. If the bank account validation fails, the user is notified of the issue, and the previous account details remain unchanged.
