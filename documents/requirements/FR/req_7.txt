Title: Managing Interactions between Customer's Bank Accounts and Brokerage Account

Description: The user can securely transfer funds between their brokerage account and one of their bank accounts.

Input: Source account number, desired amount, destination account number

Processing: The user selects one of their bank accounts for withdrawal or deposit. The system securely checks if the source account balance is sufficient. If the balance is sufficient, the transfer continues. If the user selects one of their bank accounts as the source, the brokerage account is automatically chosen as the destination. If the source is the brokerage account, the user selects one of their bank accounts as the destination. The transfer is securely carried out by the bank interface, and all transfer actions, including unsuccessful attempts, are logged for auditing purposes.

Output: Change in the customer's account balances.

Error Handling: If the transfer fails, an appropriate error message is displayed. The error is logged for further review, and no partial transactions occur in case of failure.
