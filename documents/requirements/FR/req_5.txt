Title: Blocking Funds in Bank Account

Description: A specified amount of money is securely blocked in the customer's bank account, ensuring the customer cannot access those funds.

Input: Amount to be blocked

Processing: The bank account is predetermined, and during the purchase process, the account balance is securely checked to ensure it is greater than the amount to be blocked. If sufficient, a secure block request is sent to the bank interface, and the request is logged for auditing purposes. The bank confirms the operation, and the system securely records the confirmation.

Output: The specified amount is blocked in the customer's bank account, and the transaction is logged.

Error Handling: If the amount to be blocked exceeds the total account balance, or if the blocking operation fails, an appropriate error message is displayed. The error event is logged for further review.
