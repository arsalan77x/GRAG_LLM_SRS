Title: Providing a Tabular Report of the Stock Market Status

Description: Displaying the current market status in a tabular format with real-time updates.

Input: None

Processing: The system securely updates the market status in real-time with every change provided through the stock market web service. All data fetched and displayed are logged for auditing purposes to ensure traceability. The system must validate the integrity of data received from the web service to ensure accuracy before updating the display.

Output: A table with columns for symbol, company name, highest price, lowest price, last price, previous price, change, percentage change, best bid, and best ask. Each row shows the status of a stock symbol.

Error Handling: If the market status is not displayed due to a web service failure or data integrity issue, an appropriate error message is displayed, and the event is logged for further review.
