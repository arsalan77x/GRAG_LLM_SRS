Title: Online Purchase of Stocks and Other Securities by Special Customers

Description: Special customers can buy stocks and other securities online.

Input: Type of stock, number of shares, investment price (specified or limited), maximum price

Processing: The user must log into their account in the system. The "special" access type is checked. If the access type is "special," the online purchase feature is enabled.  The user sets the investment price (specified or limited). The system checks if the number of shares is not more than the available shares. The user specifies the source account for payment (Mellat Bank, Saman Bank, brokerage account). The system securely checks the account balance. If sufficient, the amount is blocked until the final confirmation. The system assigns a unique order number, records the order, and logs the transaction for auditing purposes. Once the purchase is confirmed, the money is securely withdrawn from the user's account. The purchased shares are added to the user's portfolio, and the order report is securely added to the user's order list.

Output: Adding purchased shares to the user's portfolio, adding the order report to the user's order list.

Error Handling: If any of the following occur, an appropriate error message is displayed: - The user's access type is "regular" - The purchased shares are not added to the user's portfolio - The order report is not added to the user's order list - The order number is not assigned. The error is logged for further review, and no partial transactions occur in case of failure.
