      "1. \n",

      "   Content Reference: Entities Related to Bank Account Validation\n",

      "   Suggested Solution: Modify the requirement to include validation through the bank interface to ensure that the account information is verified against the bank's records.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \n",
      "   Relationship: Complete Violation\n",
      "   Content Reference: Error Messages\n",
      "   Reason: The requirement specifies that if the customer's bank account is invalid, the system proceeds without notifying the customer. This is a violation of best practices, as effective error handling and communication are essential for maintaining user trust and transparency.\n",
      "   Suggested Solution: Implement a mechanism to notify the customer when their bank account is invalid, providing clear error messages and guidance on corrective actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. \n",
      "   Relationship: Partial Violation\n",
      "   Content Reference: Confirmation Messages\n",
      "   Reason: While the output includes confirmation of account validity or invalidity, the lack of notification for invalid accounts undermines the effectiveness of this confirmation process. Users should receive feedback regardless of the outcome.\n",
      "   Suggested Solution: Ensure that confirmation messages are sent for both valid and invalid accounts, with appropriate details for each scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \n",
      "   Relationship: Partial Violation\n",
      "   Content Reference: Bank Account\n",
      "   Reason: The requirement mentions validating the bank account but does not specify the importance of using accurate data entry for the account number and bank name. This omission could lead to potential errors in the validation process.\n",
      "   Suggested Solution: Emphasize the need for accurate data entry in the requirement to ensure effective validation.\n",

      "5. \n",
      "   Relationship: Complete Violation\n",
      "   Content Reference: Bank Interface\n",
