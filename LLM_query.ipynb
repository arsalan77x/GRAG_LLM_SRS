ISO/IEC 27001 (Clause A.9.4) emphasizes the need for secure handling of input data, which includes server-side validation to prevent malicious data from reaching the backend. Relying solely on client-side validation leaves the system vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  \n",

Regulatory standards emphasize the importance of audit logging for all authentication attempts (both successful and failed) to detect potential threats and ensure compliance. This omission could hinder the ability to track unauthorized access attempts and respond effectively.  \n",

      "- **Interpretations:**\n",
      "  1. **User Experience Focus:** The response time requirement ensures that users experience minimal delay when executing trades, which is crucial for maintaining satisfaction and trust in a high-stakes trading environment.\n",
      "  2. **System Load Management:** The requirement implies that the system must efficiently manage resources and optimize processing to handle the peak load of 4 million users simultaneously without exceeding the 500-millisecond threshold.\n",
      "  3. **Variable Conditions:** The response time can vary based on external factors such as stock exchange rate changes, suggesting that the system must be adaptable and resilient to fluctuations in external data sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Component 2: Availability and Uptime\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Interpretations:**\n",
      "  1. **Operational Reliability:** The 99% uptime requirement indicates a high level of reliability, ensuring that the system is consistently operational during the critical trading window, minimizing downtime and potential revenue loss.\n",
      "  2. **Infrastructure Resilience:** This requirement suggests that the underlying infrastructure must be robust, with redundancy and failover mechanisms in place to maintain availability even in the face of hardware or network failures.\n",
      "  3. **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** The uptime requirement could be tied to SLAs with users and stakeholders, ensuring that the system meets contractual obligations and maintains trust with clients.\n",

      "### Component 3: Scalability and Graceful Degradation\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Interpretations:**\n",
      "  1. **Future-Proofing:** Scalability to handle up to 6 million users indicates that the system is designed to accommodate future growth and unexpected surges, ensuring long-term viability and competitiveness.\n",
      "  2. **Prioritization of Core Functions:** Graceful degradation ensures that essential trading operations remain functional during overloads, highlighting the prioritization of critical features over non-essential ones.\n",
      "  3. **User Communication:** The requirement to provide feedback during degraded service suggests an emphasis on transparent communication with users, maintaining trust even when performance is compromised.\n",

      "- **Interpretations:**\n",
      "  1. **Business Continuity Planning:** The RTO and RPO requirements emphasize the importance of business continuity planning, ensuring that the system can quickly recover from failures with minimal data loss and disruption.\n",
      "  2. **Data Integrity Assurance:** The RPO requirement highlights a focus on data integrity, ensuring that user transactions and data remain intact and reliable even in the event of a system failure.\n",
      "  3. **Regulatory Compliance:** These objectives may be driven by regulatory requirements, ensuring that the system meets industry standards for data protection and operational continuity, thus avoiding potential legal and financial penalties. \n",
